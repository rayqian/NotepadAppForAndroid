# NotepadAppForAndroid

• This app allows the creation and maintenance of multiple notes. Any number of notes are allowed (including no notes at all). Notes are made up of a title, a note text, and a last-update time.

• Notes would be saved to (and loaded from) the internal file system in JSON format. If no file is found upon loading, the application should start with no existing notes and no errors. (A new JSON file would then be created when new notes are saved).
